# world_nbt

An NBT editor GUI for Minecraft world data!

This is going to be a spin off similar to my player-editor project, but instead using a GUI to edit NBT data for worlds. I am going to start with Bedrock, and possibly expand to the other editions next too.

I'm also trying to work on "move fast, break when necessary". Made that quote up now. I want to test things, find out what works, what doesn't, then build better more secure versions of those concepts once the ugly parts have been discovered and worked through.
